# SONIC ARTIFICE DESIGNATION

## BOOM (Broadband Oscillation Output Mechanism)

### Multi-Mode Sonic Artifice System
- **Function**: Generates and directs waves of sonic force at variable frequencies and amplitudes
- **Design**: Integrated resonator array with configurable output patterns
- **Operational Mechanics**: Converts mechanical energy into sonic vibrations through adaptive frequency modulators
- **Integration**: Primary resonator chambers in chest carapace with secondary emitters in shoulder assemblies
- **Control Interface**: Modular frequency controls with tactical mode selection

### Mode 1: Area Disruption (Thunderwave)
- **Configuration**: Broad-spectrum sonic wave in forward-projecting pattern
- **Tactical Application**: 15-foot cube area effect, pushes targets back 10 feet on failed save
- **Damage Output**: 2d8 thunder damage (Constitution saving throw DC 16 for half)
- **Technical Specifications**:
  - Utilizes modulated compression waves for high-amplitude sonic discharge
  - Amplification grid projects force in precise geometric pattern
  - Kinetic displacement properties suitable for crowd control
  - Lower frequency, higher amplitude output optimized for pushing effect

### Mode 2: Focused Disruption (Shatter)
- **Configuration**: Concentrated high-frequency sonic pulse at targeted location
- **Tactical Application**: 10-foot radius sphere area effect, particularly effective against crystalline structures
- **Damage Output**: 3d8 thunder damage (Constitution saving throw DC 16 for half)
- **Technical Specifications**:
  - Adaptive frequency tuning to match target material resonance
  - Higher frequency, concentrated output for material disruption
  - Precision targeting system for remote deployment
  - Particularly effective against crystal, glass, and brittle materials

### System Integration
- Calibrated resonance chambers prevent damage to operator systems
- Adaptive frequency control allows for environmental optimization
- Impact shock absorption prevents operational recoil
- ROD (Enhanced Arcane Focus) provides improved targeting and effect amplification
- Battlefield analysis suite identifies optimal frequency for target disruption

Current tactical applications have proven the Focused Disruption mode particularly effective against BlueShot crystal formations. The system's adaptability to different sonic output patterns makes it versatile for various combat scenarios.
