## CONVERSATION HISTORY

### Initial Mission Context
**[Initial Activation - April 06, 2025]**
- Rupert requested initialization of mission log and conversational record
- GAIA activated and separated mission log from conversational record as requested
- Initial system suggested four possible next steps for investigation:
  1. Compile reference document on Braeneage
  2. Analyze differences between Heimr and Braeneage cosmological positions
  3. Generate investigation plan for understanding the sun's relighting
  4. Review operational capabilities of the R.S.S. ALICE and IRON HELM

    - LockDown Harpoon/The Golden Spear (3d8 with Immovable Rod functionality)

### Character and Environmental Adaptation
**[Character Sheet Created]**
- Comprehensive character sheet for Rupert Roads created
- Weather Class (WC) system explained and added to character sheet:
  - Similar to AC, starts at base 10
  - Current WC: 15 (Base 10 + DakFur Cloak WC+3 + Fine Damascus Scale Mail WC+2)
  - Despite being an Automaton, Rupert requires temperature regulation for internal hydraulics and systems
  - Internal energy core radiates heat through conduits, requiring protection in extreme cold

**[Encumbrance System Clarified]**
- Braeneage has higher gravity affecting carrying capacity:
  - Standard D&D multiplier reduced from 15 to 5
  - Rupert's carrying capacity: 80 lbs (Strength 16 Ã— 5)
- BAG (Burden Adjustment Gadget) requires an active infusion to function
- Maximum of 2 active infusions available at level 5, must be chosen after each long rest
- Current weight carried: 77.75 lbs (2.25 lbs under capacity)
