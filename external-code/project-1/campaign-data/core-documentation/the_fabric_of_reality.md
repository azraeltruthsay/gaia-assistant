# THE FABRIC OF REALITY
**Version: 1.0**

## SECTION I: THE GENESIS OF ALL THINGS

### The Primordial Duality

In the time before time existed, there were only two fundamental forces:

**PRIMORDIS - The Infinite Ocean of Chaos**
* An ever-shifting sea where no form was kept for any length of time
* A vast ocean of everything that could ever be, reality in constant flux
* Within this chaotic sea, objects transform unpredictably - a broom becomes a whale, which stands and sings before exploding into a storm of musical notes
* The source of all creative energy and potential in existence

**NONDIS - The Void of Order**
* A stark, bleak ordered nothingness above the chaos
* The antithesis to Primordis's chaos - perfect, judging, ordered blackness
* The source of all structure and constancy
* Devoid of change or transformation

### The Birth of the Cosmos

The moment of creation occurred when:
1. A large wave of chaos within Primordis rose up and inadvertently caught a pocket of Nondis
2. This "invasion" or "infection" of Order within Chaos formed the first plane - Arbolia
3. The seed of order left from Nondis caused the chaos to take form
4. This interaction created the foundations of reality: planes, time, and life itself

"Chaos chained to Order" describes this relationship, mirroring how the relativity of mass and distance underpins time.

### The First Entities

From this cosmic birth emerged the first living beings:

**CERNUNNOS - The First God**
* Born on the plane of Arbolia from a divine egg
* God of nature and time, the great hunter
* The first living entity described by reality using the six attributes (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma)
* His emergence triggered the formation of further planes and time

**THE TITANS - Children of Nondis**
* Born as a natural reaction to Cernunnos's emergence
* Not created purposefully, but formed like oil separating from water
* Six Titans representing the fundamental attributes of existence:
  * Quiyaran (Strength)
  * Irniorade (Alacrity)
  * Foedus (Health)
  * Memonium (Thought)
  * Amissia (Beauty)
  * AO (Wisdom)

## SECTION II: THE DAWN OF GODS AND MORTALS

### The Shaping of the Cosmos

After the emergence of Cernunnos and the Titans:
1. Primordis, angered by the ordered existence, sent beings to destroy Arbolia
2. Nondis, feeling the pain of the attack, also withdrew support
3. However, Arbolia and Cernunnos had retained small connections to both realms
4. On the shores of Arbolia, numerous divine eggs formed along ley-lines of power
5. From these eggs hatched the first godlings, who created new planes with varied landscapes

### The First Conflict

* Primordis sent hordes of minion-soldiers to destroy the young godlings
* Nondis, feeling love for the planes, sent its Titans to defend against the armies of Primordis
* This protection gave the gods time to grow and learn
* Eventually, the gods turned from the Titans' influence, blocking the Cosmos from their access

### The Creation of Mortals

* AO, the Titan of Wisdom, saw that the gods were alone in the world and needed companions
* Using a small conduit of connection between Nondis and the Planes, AO influenced the gods
* AO pressed upon them the desire for creation
* The oldest gods met and decided to create children and a place for them to live
* The first Material Planes were formed and filled with Dwarves, Elves, Orcs, Fey, and other ancient races
* These planes were modeled after Arbolia, creating perfect endless landscapes of forest and grass

### The Titans' Transformation

Over an immeasurable span of time, separated from what they were created to represent, the Titans transformed:

| Original Titan | Transformed Into |
|----------------|------------------|
| Quiyaran, Titan of Strength | Quiyaran, Titan of Slaughter |
| Irniorade, Titan of Alacrity | Irniorade, Titan of Trickery |
| Foedus, Titan of Health | Foedus, Titan of Decay |
| Memonium, Titan of Thought | Memonium, Titan of Insanity |
| Amissia, Titan of Beauty | Amissia, Titan of Lust |
| AO, Titan of Wisdom | AO, Titan of Creation* |

*Unlike the others, AO was exalted rather than corrupted, often taking names with the initials "AO" (Alexander Orion, Aaron O'Niel, etc.)

## SECTION III: THE COSMIC STRUCTURE

### The Cosmic Bowl

The planes are arranged in a structured formation:
* Visualized as a bowl, with each plane forming a "slat" along the curve
* The planes create a continuum from the most chaotic to the most ordered realms
* Each plane represents different balances of the primordial forces

### The Astral Sea

The connective medium between all planes:
* A vast liquid ocean filling the bowl of the planes
* Contains "balls" of varying density (the Elemental Planes)
* Filled with currents that act as portals between planes
* To a creature within it, appears as an endless ocean with no true bottom or edge
* Its surface physically manifests as the emptiness of space between stars
* Can be navigated by skilled Astral Navigators who perceive its currents

The Astral Sea exists beyond normal comprehension—what travelers perceive is merely their mind's interpretation of the incomprehensible:
* Sentient minds automatically perceive it as a vast liquid ocean
* The blackness of space visible from Mortal Planes is actually the Astral Sea's surface
* Navigational currents function like wormholes with fixed source and destination points
* Transitions to other planes often manifest as approaching islands, passing through storms, or plunging over waterfalls
* Connections between the Astral Sea and other planes typically appear as bodies of water
* Some islands within the Sea contain cave entrances leading to other planes
* All these perceptions are the mind's way of processing planar transitions as the soul moves through the Cosmos

### The Elemental Planes

The foundational building blocks of reality:
* Denser "balls" within the Astral Sea
* Composed of compressed, raw elemental energy (fire, water, earth, air, etc.)
* Relatively simple in composition
* Contain sparse settlements amid vast expanses of pure elemental energy

### The Outlands

The boundary between the inner and outer cosmos:
* Forms a wax-like coating along the inside of the cosmic bowl
* Separates the Outer Planes from the Inner Planes
* Serves as neutral ground between the alignments of the Outer Planes
* Contains the Great City of Sigil at its base, home to the Lady of Pain

### The Mortal Planes

The realms of mortal existence:
* Represented as "balls" floating at the surface of the Astral Sea
* Heimr and Brænēage are examples of Mortal Planes
* Where mortal life thrives and civilizations develop

### The Ethereal Plane

The conduit for spiritual transition:
* A layer of smoke floating above the bowl of the Cosmos
* The plane through which the soul stream flows
* Carries souls of the dead to their final destination in the Outer Planes
* Powerful souls can attempt to influence their destination
* Conflicted souls are dropped into the Outlands near their aligned plane

### The Abyss

The birth of chaos in the ordered cosmos:
* Formed when Primordis found a pinhole crack, a leak in reality
* Land around this rift began to warp and split, falling into the rift
* Created a conduit through which Primordis could push its chaos into the ordered Cosmos
* As chaotic thoughts entered the plane, they were forced into forms with increasing definition
* This caused intense pain and anguish for these beings, which became known as Demons (Tanari')
* Effectively infinite, where distance and time are relative concepts
* Becomes increasingly chaotic and disordered in deeper layers
* Upper layers filled with demons vying for control
* Deeper layers exhibit increasing chaos and less order
* Deepest levels almost indistinguishable from Primordis
* Demons are born from pure chaos in the deepest Abyss, gaining sentience as they ascend
* Environment is antithetical to life: blazing hot air, ashen skies, lakes of lava, etc.

## SECTION IV: THE NATURE OF MAGIC

### The Fundamental Nature of Magic

Magic is, at its core, Chaos exerting dominance over Order. While the Cosmic Bowl floats within the vast ocean of Primordis, chaotic energy continuously flows through a pinhole leak at the edge of the Outer Plane of The Abyss. This raw chaos—the seed and source of all magic—carries specific "frequencies" that can be identified and harnessed by practitioners of various magical arts.

As magical energy traverses the Cosmos, it becomes "stained" or influenced by each plane it enters and exits. These flows of magical energy form the interconnecting ley lines that crisscross reality. Their specific function—whether arcane, divine, or other—is defined by the planes these lines have passed through during their journey.

### The Metaphysics of Magical Flow

The interactions between magic and the Cosmos can be understood through this metaphor:

Imagine every boundary between planes as a special refractive/reflective surface, where slightly different energy levels either refract through or reflect off the boundary. The energy of magic—these ley lines—can be visualized as trillions of tiny lasers shot through the Abyssal leak, each at slightly different angles.

Each "laser" follows a unique trajectory, striking different planar boundaries with varying energy levels. The resulting web of interconnecting ley lines forms the magical infrastructure that practitioners tap into to access their power. While the Cosmos exists as Nondis forcing order upon the Chaos of Primordis, magic represents the counter-force—Primordis forcing Chaos back into Order.

### Magic Types in Detail

**Arcane Magic**
* Formed when magical energy reflects off the boundaries of outer planes or refracts through godless outer planes
* Accessed through the discipline of Arcana—rituals, incantations, and formulae
* Arcana itself was developed by the first gods of knowledge and magic
* Offered freely to all beings who know where to look
* Requires technical mastery, study, and understanding
* Channeled through words, actions, and material components
* Often requires focus objects like rods and wands
* Typically practiced by Wizards, Sorcerers, and Warlocks
* Subject to strict regulation by authorities due to historical misuse

**Divine Magic**
* Created when magical energy interacts with the plane of a god or similarly powerful divine being
* Carries the frequency or "stain" of the divine being it contacted
* Gods maintain control over this power, offering it to those who grant them worship
* Accessed through devotion, prayer, and ritual observance
* Does not require the technical understanding demanded by arcane practice
* Channeled through symbols, ceremonies, and invocations
* Practitioners include Clerics, Paladins, and some Druids
* Viewed with suspicion in many regions due to the history of Ayam's corrupt priests

**Ur Magic**
* Not truly a separate type of magic but a method of accessing divine power without worship
* Created when the first gods gave mortals rituals and incantations similar to Arcana
* Designed to extract divine power directly from the gods' ley lines
* Originally given only to the Jade Phoenix Magi during the First Conflict with the Titans
* Used by gods and mortals to imprison the Titans after their defeat
* Extremely rare and potentially dangerous knowledge
* Practitioners known as Ur Priests can siphon divine power without a god's permission
* Critical to some rituals involving divine ascension or transformation

**Psionic Magic**
* A relatively recent discovery in magical taxonomy
* Taps into a higher frequency of energy permeating the Cosmos
* Largely unaffected by the planar structure that influences other magical types
* Not accessible using traditional Arcana
* If arcane and divine magic are akin to visible light, psionics would be like X-rays
* Generated from within a sentient creature's mind
* Directly influences reality without external components
* Exceptionally rare and powerful
* Practitioners include Psions and certain monastic traditions

### The Flow of Magic in History

The understanding of magic has evolved throughout cosmic history:
1. Primordial Era: The first gods developed Arcana, teaching it to their favored mortals
2. Titan Conflict: Ur Magic was created as a weapon against the Titans
3. Age of Divine Rule: Gods controlled magic through direct intervention
4. Post-Ayam Era: After the god-slaying, magic became less stable but more widespread
5. Current Era: Magic is regulated, feared, and often misunderstood

### Practical Applications

Magic manifests in countless ways across the Cosmos:
* Spellcasting: The most common and direct application
* Item Enchantment: Infusing objects with magical properties
* Planar Travel: Opening pathways between realms
* Divination: Gaining knowledge of past, present, or future
* Creation and Destruction: Manifestation and unmaking of matter and energy
* Transformation: Changing one thing into another
* Life Manipulation: Healing, harming, or altering living beings

## SECTION V: THE COSMIC CYCLE AND INTERCOSMIC ENTITIES

### The Cycle of Cosmoses

* Our Cosmos is neither the first nor the last
* Cosmoses form from the interaction of Order and Chaos
* Eventually dissolve back into Primordis
* Cosmic Eras defined by magical energy flowing in spurts
* Creates periods of magical abundance and drought

### Primordis: The Intercosmic Sea

* Exists outside the boundaries of individual Cosmoses
* Potential conduit for travel between Cosmoses
* Incredibly dangerous to traverse

### Intercosmic Entities

Beings that cross between cosmoses possess unique properties and face extraordinary challenges:
* Cosmic Signature: Tied to their home Cosmos with its unique laws of physics
* Resilience: Incredibly difficult to destroy outside their home Cosmos
* Travel Requirements: Requires immense power and magical mastery
* Transformation: Physical form forced to conform to the laws of the new Cosmos
* Soul Incompatibility: Soul cannot be processed by foreign cosmic rules

Travel between Cosmoses is theoretically impossible. Primordis—the Vastness of Potential—is far too chaotic and dangerous to exist within for even an instant. However, exceptionally powerful beings have managed this feat through extraordinary means.

**Example: Tharizdun**
* Most powerful being in his entire home Cosmos
* Mastered every magic and technology his reality could produce
* Built a specialized vessel and performed complex ritual for one-time intercosmic travel
* Did not navigate through Primordis, but was drawn to our Cosmos as the only other possible ordered reality
* Original form resembled floating crystals in a roughly humanoid pattern
* Physical form painfully transformed into humanoid shape upon arrival (default form patterned after Cernunnos)
* Soul cannot be processed by our Cosmos due to fundamentally different laws
* Cannot be permanently destroyed as his soul cannot be recycled into the matter of our planes
* Through his own power and sentience, he enforces the truth of his own existence

### Potential Threats

* Intercosmic entities can disrupt cosmic balance
* Their existence defies the fundamental laws of reality
* They may consciously or unconsciously warp nearby reality toward their home Cosmos's laws
* Their souls cannot be destroyed, making them permanent problems
* Multiple such entities could cause catastrophic consequences for the entire Cosmos
