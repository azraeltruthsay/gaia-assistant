### Issue: Segmentation Fault in `llama_cpp`

*   **Symptoms:** The application crashes with a `Segmentation fault` when running a prompt. The traceback points to `app/cognition/external_voice.py` and the `llama_cpp` library.
*   **Hypothesis:** The crash is caused by multi-threaded access to the `llama_cpp` library from the `ExternalVoice` class.
*   **Fix Applied:** Modified `app/cognition/external_voice.py` to remove the worker thread and queue, making the call to `create_chat_completion` a direct, single-threaded operation.
*   **Status:** `Pending Validation`

### Issue: JSON Decoding Error in `CognitiveDispatcher`

*   **Symptoms:** A `WARNING` message in the logs indicates that the 'lite' model is not returning a valid JSON object.
*   **Hypothesis:** The 'lite' model is not reliably following the instruction to return a JSON object, and the regex used to extract the JSON is not robust enough.
*   **Fix Applied:** Modified `app/cognition/cognitive_dispatcher.py` to use a more flexible regex that can handle cases where the JSON is embedded in other text.
*   **Status:** `Pending Validation`

### Enhancement: Prompt Builder Chain-of-Thought & Confirmation Injection

*   **Change:** Updated `app/utils/prompt_builder.py` to inject chain-of-thought and confirmation instructions as a system message before the user input.
*   **Purpose:** Improves LLM reliability and safety for multi-step or state-changing tasks.
*   **Status:** Confirmed functional in CLI and rescue shell.

### Validation: Observer Interrupts and Output Routing

*   **Observation:** StreamObserver is actively monitoring LLM output and issuing interrupts/corrections as needed. OutputRouter is parsing and routing structured responses as designed.
*   **Status:** Confirmed functional. Observer interrupts are respected and handled in the pipeline.

### Pipeline: Confirmed Functional Components

*   **ModelPool:** Loads and manages prime, lite, and embedding models.
*   **SessionManager:** Handles persistent session and history management.
*   **AgentCore:** Orchestrates Reason-Act-Reflect loop, including intent detection, planning, reflection, and action execution.
*   **PromptBuilder:** Assembles context-rich, budget-aware prompts with injected reasoning instructions.
*   **SelfReflection:** Critiques and refines plans using LLM.
*   **StreamObserver:** Monitors and interrupts LLM output for safety.
*   **OutputRouter:** Parses and routes structured LLM output.
*   **ThoughtSeed:** Generates and saves thought seeds for future recall.
*   **Status:** All core components validated in end-to-end CLI and rescue shell runs.
