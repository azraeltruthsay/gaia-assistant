# GAIA Enhancement Feasibility Assessment - Legacy (Some of these ideas have been implemented already)


## Feasibility Overview

1. **Larger Context Windows/Document Flyout**
   - **Feasibility**: High
   - **Approach**: Implementing a document workspace that exists alongside the chat, using a separate tab or split-screen interface. The LLM could generate content in chunks and compile them.

2. **Identity Management with Authentication**
   - **Feasibility**: High
   - **Approach**: Standard web authentication frameworks like Flask-Login or JWT can be integrated without significant architectural changes.

3. **Multiple Project Management**
   - **Feasibility**: High
   - **Approach**: Add project metadata to the database schema, with separate vector stores per project. UI would need project switching controls.

4. **Image Generation/Processing**
   - **Feasibility**: Medium
   - **Approach**: Integrate with Stable Diffusion or similar via API. The computational requirements will increase significantly.

5. **Pause/Resume Processing**
   - **Feasibility**: Medium
   - **Approach**: Add state management to track processing status and implement cancellation hooks in the request handling pipeline.

6. **LoRA Fine-tuning**
   - **Feasibility**: Medium-High
   - **Approach**: PEFT/LoRA integration is feasible but requires careful implementation of training loops and model versioning. Multiple LLMs studying together would be experimental but technically possible.

7. **Dynamic Context Management**
   - **Feasibility**: High
   - **Approach**: Implement a conversation summarization function that triggers at threshold points, with importance weighting for content retention.

8. **Conversational Content Generation with Templates**
   - **Feasibility**: High
   - **Approach**: Extend the existing artifact generation to support conversational templating with real-time vector store updates.
