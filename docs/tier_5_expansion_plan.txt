🎨 Tier 5 Expansion Map for GAIA
Goal: Gradual, manageable steps to turn GAIA into a living campaign companion.

🌱 Phase 1: Meta-Memory Layer

Step	What to Build	Notes
1.1	meta_memory.json per project	Track emotional state, lessons learned, player relationships.
1.2	Update after each session	After each D&D session, append memory/summaries.
1.3	Expose "meta" to core prompts	Let GAIA know how she's supposed to feel today.
🧠 Phase 2: Dynamic Personality Adjustment

Step	What to Build	Notes
2.1	"Mood" System	Internal states like Curious, Focused, Melancholy.
2.2	Influence word choice subtly	More adjectives? More formal speech? Witty vs Stoic?
2.3	Trigger moods based on events	Big battle = somber GAIA. Light town visit = playful GAIA.
🛠 Phase 3: Self-Reflection and Growth

Step	What to Build	Notes
3.1	End-of-session self-prompt	GAIA asks: "What did I learn? What should I improve?"
3.2	Adjust instruction snippets	Save tiny behavior tweaks for next sessions.
🎯 Phase 4: Sub-Goal System

Step	What to Build	Notes
4.1	Minor Task List for GAIA	Example: "Research city of Heimr overnight."
4.2	Background Processing Expansion	Schedule goal fulfillment overnight (during BG processor runs).
🚀 Phase 5: Aspect LoRA Adapters (Advanced)

Step	What to Build	Notes
5.1	LoRA generator module (optional)	Let GAIA spin small adapters when campaign arcs finish.
5.2	Dynamic aspect switching	Choose tactical GAIA vs lorekeeper GAIA depending on need.
