# GAIA Error Handling Strategy

## Overview

In order to create a robust, maintainable, and easily debuggable system, GAIA will implement a standardized **error fingerprinting system**. Each potential failure point in the application will log a unique error code in the format `ERR-GAIA-XXXX`. This system is inspired by Windows Event IDs and is intended to:

- Improve debugging efficiency.
- Enable cross-referencing errors across code, logs, and documentation.
- Provide rapid localization of issues for developers and maintainers.
- Enable future automation around error detection and alerting.

This strategy will be codified into a living document: `gaia_errors.md`, which maps error codes to their descriptions and typical causes.

## Purpose of `gaia_errors.md`

- **Catalog all error codes** in the GAIA system.
- **Describe** the context and meaning of each error.
- **Identify** potential causes and suggested resolutions.
- **Serve as a master lookup table** for development, testing, debugging, and maintenance.
- **Ensure consistency** across multiple modules.

## Error Code Format

| Format | Meaning |
|:-------|:--------|
| `ERR-GAIA-1xxx` | AI Manager core errors |
| `ERR-GAIA-2xxx` | Web routes / Flask API errors |
| `ERR-GAIA-3xxx` | Background processor / task errors |
| `ERR-GAIA-4xxx` | Vector store and embedding errors |
| `ERR-GAIA-5xxx` | Document processing errors |
| `ERR-GAIA-6xxx` | Behavior management errors |
| `ERR-GAIA-7xxx` | Code analyzer errors |
| `ERR-GAIA-8xxx` | Session management errors |
| `ERR-GAIA-9xxx` | General internal system or unknown errors |

## Systematic Configuration Plan

1. **Identify every major failure point** in the GAIA codebase.
   - During development, code review, or refactor.
2. **Assign a unique error code** to each potential failure location.
   - Use sequential numbering within each category.
3. **Log the error** with the assigned code:
   ```python
   logger.error("ERR-GAIA-1001: Failed to load vector store", exc_info=True)
   ```
4. **Raise exceptions** that include the error code when appropriate:
   ```python
   raise RuntimeError("ERR-GAIA-1001: Vector store not available")
   ```
5. **Document the error** in `gaia_errors.md`.
6. **Cross-reference** the error codes in feature documentation if needed.

## Notes for Ongoing Development

- **Every new feature** should include assigned error codes where failure is possible.
- **Every major try/except block** should have error codes logged in the `except` section.
- **All new modules** should have a reserved error code block (e.g., if a new Speech Recognition module is added, maybe `ERR-GAIA-10xxx`).
- **Update `gaia_errors.md` immediately** upon introducing a new code.
- **Code reviewers** should verify error code usage during code review.

## Benefits Summary

- üîç Rapid traceability.
- üß† Easier onboarding for new developers.
- üõ†Ô∏è Simplified maintenance and debugging.
- üìà Clear audit trail for production issues.

This system ensures that GAIA remains a professional-grade, developer-friendly platform, even as it grows and evolves.
