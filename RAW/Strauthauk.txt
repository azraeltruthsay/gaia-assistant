Strauthauk's Extent:

    How much of Vedania does Strauthauk currently encompass? - Strauthauk's northern border is Castle Straussen, which sits on an island in the River Sehtek(sp?) and controls all access to the monster-filled lands north of the river. Small fishing and farming villages dot the shore of Lake Pesche, with ships plying the waters for fish or trade. The City of Coschale is nestled near the eastern shore of the lake further south from Castle Straussen and its surrounding village. Coschale is roughly central to the kingdom, with the trade outpost of Grothen sitting on the southeastern corner of the lake and providing trade access to remote parts of the Kingdom with Mount Artas and its Kimrl Mine to the south, the logging village of Occatto to the east along the foothills of the Ferrum Mountains, and the small chandlery and apiary village of Lamble deep in the southern forest. 
        Is it the majority, a significant portion, or a smaller region? - The borders of Strauthauk are difficult to define due to uncertain and shaky treaties with the elves in the nearby forests. Generally, Strauthauk encompasses the lands between Lake Pesche and the Ferrum Mountains as the west and east borders, with the northern river and the souther Mount Kimrl marking roughly the north and south borders. 
    Are there other independent kingdoms or territories within Vedania besides Strauthauk? - Within Vedania, the Llausakian lords are still present, though their lands have fallen into darkness and ruin. They are vampire lords who use human thralls as slave labor and maintain an air of extravagence and royalty that reminds them of their previous status and provides decent cover for their slave society. They make pretense of civility in diplomatic meetings. The Elves of the Arboleian forest live nearby as well, and their kingdom is at a tenuous peace with the humans, as long as the humans stick to the trade routes and cart paths, staying out of the deep woods. 

King Eirich Strauss:

    What is the general disposition of King Eirich?
        Is he a beloved ruler, a tyrant, or something in between?
        Are there any internal or external threats to his rule?
    How does the change in political structure affect the roles and power of Barons and Arls within Strauthauk?

Castle Straussen:

    Where is Castle Straussen located within Vedania?
        Is it centrally located, or on a border?
    Are there any notable features or defenses of the castle that might be relevant to the campaign?

Political Tensions:

    The "Mysterious Mundane" document mentions tensions between the Breckenars and the Neralys.
        How does this tension play out within the context of Strauthauk?
        Are these families still influential, and what are their current positions?
      

    Are there other significant political factions or power groups within Strauthauk?

Setting Elements:

    Given that we are focusing on Strauthauk, how do elements like the Supplicants of Light and Dark, the prevalence of magic, and the presence of ruins beyond Lake Pesche fit into this new structure?
    Are there any specific locations within Strauthauk that you want to highlight (e.g., Athema, Lamble, Persiae, Coschale)?

Adventure Hooks:

    Considering this simplified political structure, how might the initial adventure hooks from "The Mysterious Mundane" or "The Devil You Know" need to be adapted?
        For example, how does the conflict over the "Accounting of Divine Effort" play out in Strauthauk?



I'm going to simplify things for this campaign, which I'll call Sunrise in the Valley, since that previous campaign never really happened.


For this campaign, Sunrise in the Valley, most of the political and societal information about Vedania is historical for context. The modern world in Sunrise in the Valley is a world where Strauthauk is the major human kingdom, with the ruler being King Eirich Strauss. He rules from Castle Straussen. Please review the Sunrise in the Valley document for a small sample of the recent simplified political structure. Then please request clarifications to fill in the gaps. 


Setting: 

I would like this to take place in the Cosmos we've defined within The Fabric of Reality, within the Prime Mortal Plane of Heimr, on the continent of Co'Lire, and in the lands called Vedania. Specifically I would like to stay focused on the Veda Valley which is a large lush green area covering from about the middle of Vedania toward Lake Pesche in the east. Beyond Lake Pesche are the various cities, towns, villages and many ruins of previous civilizations. Beyond that is the Ferrum Mountain range. 


Dying of the Light and the rise of the Great Ayam:

About 200 years ago, a man's family was killed as innocent casualties in a religious war.

The man, Ayam, then dedicated his life to understanding a form of magic called Ur magic.


Ur magic was given to mortals by the first gods as a way to tap into divine power without directly praying to a god.


Ayam worked with a group of similarly motivated people with various skills and abilities.

Through a complex series of events he was able to build a The GodKiller Engine that could target a god in its home plane and siphon all the god's power away, killing it.


In this way, Ayam killed all the gods and left mortals to fend for themselves.


The life-giving stars themselves had been servants of the Sun God, and now with his death, they lost the source of their power as well. The world was plunged into darkness, after which Ayam with his godly power provided divine sunlight to his high priests. These high priests could provide the sunlight to their local cities, villages, and the like, but the Clerics of the great Ayam became corrupt and held back the light for personal profit. Societies and cultures fell as the clerics wrenched all power from the nobility to fuel their own greed. After almost 200 years, the cleric's divine light finally failed, for while Ayam had taken divine power, he was not a god and his power had run out. The world was plunged into night for 5 full days while people prayed and prayed, looking for salvation.


A series of events happened that will be known as "The CandleLight Saga". This began during the reign of the Clerics of Ayam, and concluded with the return of Sunlight after the end of the 5 days of night. Castle Straussen was taken at the end of these events, marking the beginning of the resurgence of the modern Kingdom of Strauthauk. King Eirich Strauss is a descendant of the hero who took Castle Straussen on that fateful day.



King Strauss is a beloved by strict ruler. His kingdom is beset from the north by monsters, from the east by duplicitous elves, from the south by wild men and enigmatic druidic orders, and the west is a vast unknown land, where we find the Veda Valley proper and beyond that the kingdom of Llausak. 

Because of this, magic has always been outlawed in Strauthauk, except for special court appointed and approved mages. Divine power is tightly protected and secret. Generally only the royal court has any access to divine power, and most people still believe divine magic is a myth. Arcane magic is banned due to the dangerous nature of magic as evidenced by recent events.


However, King Eirich is fair and just. He does not overly tax his subjects, he keeps the peace with the elves, and his armies maintain control of the northern border against relentless monster incursions. He provides food and security for his people, while his strict laws are meant to prevent further risk to the kingdom from within. 


Here is a list of some of the families present in this area for the campaign.


The Strauss, Royal House of the Kingdom of Strauthauk.



The Thelan family, Noble by virtue of title given by the Strausses.


Tavid Thelan is the Magistrate in charge of the Grothen Trading Post, which acts as a hub for trade in the center of the Strauthauk Kingdom.




The Liamsors, Magic Practitioners by family tradition, though many are content to simply work in city shops and do odd jobs. A Liamsor is almost always on retainer with the Coschale University.


The Roses, a hard working family who always seem to keep their spirits up, but aren't particularly brave and adventurous.


The Blackes, hard working and highly motivated to their craft, this is a family of craftsmen, typically blacksmiths, though some have political aims.


The Pendrys, a goodly, well meaning family who offers help and food to those who need it most. Pendrys can be found in the Kimrl Work Camp as well as in the temples and slums of Coschale. There is a Pendry working in a high position at the Coschale Temple.


The Stokks, an ambitious family of Nobles. This Noble status was allowed to continue by the Royal house of Strauts after the Artasian Kingdom's collapse, and Stokks have always run the Kimrl Mine as far back as any history is written.


The Dustmights, a peasant family who makes ends meet through farming and pottery


The Winnitys, a Noble Family given lordship over Lamble, which is the primary source of honey and candles for the Kingdom of Strauthauk.


The Kaneris Family, a petty Noble family given lordship over Occatto. This Noble title was granted after Kris Kaneris' Grandfather helped to bring order back to the logging village and make a peace treaty with the local forest dwellers. The previous lord of Occato was killed by the forest's inhabitants and left no legacy.





The Neralys, Royal House of the Kingdom of Llausak


The Fiachras, Exiled Royal House of the Kingdom of Llausak 



Most families understand and accept King Eirich's rule. The noble families of Thelan, Stokk, Winnity, and Kaneris are allies and approve of the King's rule generally. The Liamsors do not like the king's decrees against magic, though they also have membership within his royal court magicians. The Liamsors feel the king's restriction of magic is a personal restriction against their family, since their family's abilities are tightly controlled by tradition and law.


The elders of the Liamsors don't realize (or care) that there are other latent magical talents out there that are also impacted by the King's ruling. The Neralys and Fiachras both have intents within their own kingdom of Llausak, where the Neralys would be potential more political rivals and the Fiachras may want to gain an alliance and get assistance retaking their kingdom of Llausak 





The CandleLight Saga Summary:
Ok, As a clarification, the CandleLight Saga did not occur only over the 5 days of night. The 5 days of night was simply the ending event of the CandleLight Saga, which began over a year earlier than that during the authoritarian reign of the Keepers of the Light, aka the Cultists of Ayam. 


Here is the story of the CandleLight Saga in simple form. The actual events were far more complex and involved many more characters, harrowing challenges, and unexpected twists, but for the sake of this campaign, a summary is fine.




Introduction: The story is set in the Veda Valley, ruled by the Order of the Keepers of the Light who are a subset of the Cultists of Ayam, in a world pervaded by darkness where small points of light sustain the settlements.



Alrich's Journey:



    Alrich is a TorchBearer of the Light who initially supports the authoritarian regime as a member of the Keepers of the Light. 



The Keepers of the Light maintain strict control over the availability of Light, and sit in a tenuous servitude at the service of the King. Alrich begins to doubt the Keepers' fearmongering and seeks a world with more light.  


The King is assassinated by the Keepers, who seize full theocratic control.  


Alrich learns of the angel Nemiel, who can bring back the light, but Alrich distrusts his potential power.  


Alrich tricks Nemiel into servitude to the Verdant Candle, directing worship toward the concept of Light.  


Nemiel had foreseen this and manipulated Alrich to ensure the Candle would be lit, sacrificing his own freedom for the good of all.  



Joreth's Path:



    Joreth, Alrich's friend, starts as a loyal follower but also questions the narrative.   



He diverges from Alrich, remaining loyal to the Keepers and possibly aiding in the King's assassination.  


Joreth becomes a prominent enforcer for the Keepers and opposes Alrich's actions while Alrich forms a rebellion.  


Eventually, Alrich kills Joreth in battle, but Joreth's lineage continues to this day.  



Other Key Characters and Events:



    Jerham Purat is introduced as the Chosen of the Jade Candle, with a tragic backstory.   



Sira Strauss, Alrich's sister, is a seer who has prophetic dreams and advises the King.  


King Beren Artasi is assassinated by the Keepers of the Light, who are infiltrated by the Llausakian Lords.  


Bakhar Shade, the Court Wizard, seeks to bring back the light through magic but is manipulated by Nemiel.  


Nemiel, the angel, offers to bring light but is distrusted and ultimately tricked by Alrich.  


Other characters like Badiha Greaves (a hedge witch) and Herrin Cordyceps (a gnome guard) are introduced.  



The Verdant Candle: The story revolves around the Verdant Candle, an artifact of great power that can bring back the light, and the struggle to control it and the light it can provide 



The CandleLight Saga is essentially the story of how the modern Kingdom of Strauthauk was born. The Keepers of the Light and generally all worshippers of Ayam are the clear villains from the perspective of Strauthauk these days, as the Cultists of Ayam had been so oppressive and authoritarian with their control of the life-giving divine light. 

How does the legacy of the CandleLight Saga and the negative perception of the Keepers of the Light/Ayam influence King Strauss's policies on religion, magic, and the exercise of power? - They are the core foundation upon which his restrictions against all divine magic and the strict limitations and control over arcane magic. They also serve as the basis for his militaristic attitude toward external threats. From the very foundation of the kingdom, the Castle Straussen has been continuously beset by various roving bands of monsters from the north, the enigmatic elves, and possible threats from within. He is a good ruler, but he sees threats everywhere and he's not entirely wrong




How much of Vedania does Strauthauk currently encompass? - Strauthauk's northern border is Castle Straussen, which sits on an island in the River Sehtek(sp?) and controls all access to the monster-filled lands north of the river.
