# BRAENEAGE GENERAL INFO - v9.1

## üåç REGION OVERVIEW

Braeneage is a fractured northern continent long held under the shifting influence of planar storms, arcane fallout, and lost civilizations. Tower incursions, divine silence, and environmental collapse have shaped its present-day politics and terrain.

## üó∫Ô∏è GEOGRAPHY

- **Snowreach**: The frozen northeast plateau where Rogue‚Äôs End is located. High magical saturation, prone to BlueShot crystallization. Site of the Moon Gate and dragon engagement.
- **Ruadh Craic**: The Red Ridge, mined for BlueShot crystal. Site of corrupted dragon Axuraud‚Äôs last known position.
- **The Thorn**: An orbital arc of broken skyships and platforms that once protected the region; mostly inert. Currently holds docking position of R.S.S. ALICE.
- **Rusthook**: A trade node between terrestrial and spelljamming operations. Current base of operations post-Escape.

## üß≠ ROGUE‚ÄôS END: MYTHIC AND TACTICAL CONCORDANCE

Rogue‚Äôs End exists at the intersection of historical tragedy and mythic resonance. Once a thriving BlueShot refinery and defensive stronghold in Snowreach, it was devastated in an arcane event that left the fortress frozen, abandoned, and inert for years.

- **The Fall (Mythic)**: As told in the *Tale of Rogue‚Äôs End*, the collapse was sudden and complete‚Äîinhabitants frozen mid-motion, magic failing catastrophically. The cause remains disputed: some speak of containment failure, others of planar interference.  
- **The Maid**: A spectral intelligence, possibly an arcane construct or a bound spirit of the Keep itself. She lay dormant until Rupert‚Äôs arrival, when she reactivated and resumed control of internal systems.  
- **Refounding**: Rupert Roads and companions re-entered Rogue‚Äôs End (Month 1, Week 2), reactivated The Maid, and began restoration. The Spelljammer ALICE was recovered beneath the site shortly thereafter.  
- **The Siege**: Tower-aligned minotaur forces attacked during the BlueShot skirmishes. The corrupted white dragon Axuraud was encountered and engaged at Ruadh Craic.  
- **Moon Gate and Extraction**: Following Axuraud‚Äôs collapse into the Moon Gate and the arrival of Mr. BOB, the party escaped aboard ALICE, which now orbits above Rusthook.

## üîÆ FACTIONS

- **The Tower**: An external force of planar manipulators and psionic networks. Believed to be exploiting BlueShot to warp time, memory, and soul patterns.
- **Autonomes**: Mechanist collective working under ALICE pre-awakening. Now integrated with Rupert‚Äôs crew.
- **The Healer / Dreamer‚Äôs Network**: Unconfirmed psychic signatures traced to dream-affected NPCs and sleepers.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è STRATEGIC NOTES

- BlueShot is both energy source and addiction vector.
- Shatter spells remain effective for disrupting crystal-based breath weapons.
- The Moon Gate may be a fixed planar link or ancient transit node; currently inactive post-Axuraud breach.
