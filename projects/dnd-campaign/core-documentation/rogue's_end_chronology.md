## üìú MYTHIC FRAME ‚Äì *As Told in the Tale of Rogue‚Äôs End*

> ‚ÄúIn the cold of final failure, a fortress froze in silence, locked between memory and purpose. The breath of duty was gone, and in its absence, stillness reigned‚Ä¶‚Äù

* **The Fall**: An arcane disaster rendered Rogue‚Äôs End inert, its inhabitants crystallized or scattered. Cause remains speculative‚Äîpotential overload from containment magic or breach of planar threshold.
* **The Maid**: A ghostlike intelligence or arcane construct, bound to the Fortress Heart. She slumbered until Rupert's return.
* **Refounding**: Rupert‚Äôs arrival reawakened The Maid and the fortress began to stir. New defenses were built atop the bones of memory.
* **The Tower‚Äôs Return**: Strange blue-armored invaders and minotaurs descended. The snows returned with them.
