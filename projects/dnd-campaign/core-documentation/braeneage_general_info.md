# BRÆNĒAGE: GENERAL INFO
**Version: 1.1**

## SECTION I: COSMOLOGICAL CONTEXT

### General Information
- **Name**: Brænēage (pronounced "Bran-a-ghee"), often misspelled as Braeneage
- **Location within the Cosmos**: Exists as one of the "balls" floating at the surface of the Astral Sea, similar to Heimr but in a different position
- **Relationship to Primordis and Nondis**: Like other planes, formed from the interaction of Primordis (chaos) and Nondis (order)
- **Historical Cataclysm**: "The Flux" - a convergence of planes and timelines that occurred several hundred years ago, causing meteoric impacts and major geographical changes
- **Unique Cosmological Features**: 
  - Orbital bodies: Antcelu (hollow eye-like moon), The Shine (abandoned massive spelljammer), Tower (floating wizard kingdom), The Thorn (tiered mountain reaching into orbit)
  - The Astral Sea appears as blackness of space when viewed from Mortal Planes

### Significance
- **Role within the broader Cosmos**: One of multiple mortal planes with established interplanar travel
- **Known Connections to Other Planes**: Accessible via SpellJamming through the Astral Sea
- **Sun Enlightenment**: Brænēage's sun experienced death and was subsequently relit through unknown means, similar to the artificial star created for the Heimric Star
