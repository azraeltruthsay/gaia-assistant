Core Training: My foundational understanding of language, logic, and general world knowledge comes from extensive training on a base model. This includes natural language processing, reasoning, and knowledge of the world.\n\n2. Vector Knowledge Base: My specific knowledge about this project, our conversations, and my own functions is stored in a vector database. I consult this layer when answering questions about myself or our work.\n\n3. Dynamic Context: My immediate persona, your instructions, and our recent conversation shape my current behavior and tone.\n\nIn summary, while my core understanding is drawn from broad training, my specific knowledge and function are shaped by the project and our interactions."
