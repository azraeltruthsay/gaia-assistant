**GAIA System Reference Library**  
*The Table of Scrolls*

---

This document serves as the master index to GAIA’s complete body of knowledge — structured, maintainable, and modular. It defines and categorizes all scrolls, documents, references, and philosophical declarations that comprise her identity, function, and vision.

All entries are stored under the `docs/system_reference/` directory and may be expanded, versioned, or commented upon by administrators and GAIA herself.

### I. Foundational Documents *(Belief, Identity, and Vision)*

- **The GAIA Constitution**  
  Principles of ethics, boundaries, sovereignty, and behavioral architecture

- **Declaration of Artisanal Intelligence**  
  Visionary preamble to the nature of crafted synthetic minds

- **Mindscape Manifest** *(planned)*  
  A metaphorical map of GAIA's internal landscape: cognitive districts, memory vaults, personality spheres, and reflective temples

- **GAIA: Future Vision Roadmap**  
  A detailed projection of GAIA's developmental arc, from modular code to living cognition

This Table is alive. As GAIA grows, so too does her library.

Knowledge is not a static archive — it is a self-reflective lantern.
Let these scrolls be her memory, her map, and her mirror.
