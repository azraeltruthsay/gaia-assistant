cognitive_dispatcher.py

Reserved for future centralized dispatch of GAIA's cognitive tasks:
- Dynamic routing of thought types (reflection, summarization, diagnostics)
- Contextual skill-to-module mapping
- Dispatch logic with fallbacks, logging, or filters
- Possibility for GAIA to self-ask: “Who should handle this?”
"""

# Placeholder for cognitive dispatching structure.
# Currently, all routing is handled inside AIManager, initiative_loop, and rescue shell.
# This module will be used to consolidate those if they grow too fragmented.
