app.memory

This package contains GAIAâ€™s memory-related systems:
- Short-term runtime state tracking (status_tracker)
- Session-level continuity and persistence (session_manager)
- Conversation summarization and logging (conversation/*)
- Structured task memory and prioritization (priority_manager)
- Emerging support for log summarization and seed management

Modules here serve GAIA's ability to recall, contextualize, prioritize, and reflect on past experience.
