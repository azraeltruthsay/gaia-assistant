Alright, let's solidify the main quest. From the documents, the central conflict revolves around the villainous wizard, Kreel Neraly, and his machinations. Here's a structured breakdown:

1. The Villain: Kreel Neraly

    Kreel is a young and powerful wizard and archivist who defies the typical wizard stereotype by resembling a noble lord.   

He is driven by the belief that the ends justify the means and seeks to save humanity by obtaining and wielding the power of the gods.  

Kreel is assisted by a druid.  

He has a network of allies within the Kingdom of Strauthauk, including members of the Royal Court and the court magi, who are motivated by their own desire for power.  

Kreel is working to acquire DarkStone ore, officially for Maleus of Ur, but plans to betray Maleus and use the DarkStone for his own ascension ritual.  

2. Key Conflicts and Plot Points

    The Kidnapping of Liasa Neraly Breckenar: Liasa's kidnapping is a significant event, as she is essential to Kreel's ritual or possesses information he needs. This kidnapping creates a time-sensitive quest for the players to rescue her.   

The Devil's Influence: A devil named Tawûsê Melek is involved, potentially offering a temporary alliance to the players against Kreel. This alliance presents a moral dilemma for the players, forcing them to weigh the risks and consequences of trusting a devil.  

The Warlocks and the Cultists: Kreel's followers, the Warlocks, are a growing threat, spreading his influence and gathering resources. This creates a broader conflict beyond Kreel himself, as the players must confront his network of supporters.  

Political Intrigue: The conflict is intertwined with the political landscape of the Kingdom of Strauthauk, involving the Royal Court, influential nobles, and tensions between the Breckenars and the Neralys.  

3. Potential Story Arcs

    The Curse of the Veda Valley: A subplot involves a rumored curse that prevents settlements of more than a couple of dozen humans from thriving due to attacks from the Valley's beasts. This could be connected to Kreel's activities or a separate mystery for the players to uncover.   

The Secret History of the Valley: The players may also discover the hidden history of the Veda Valley and the reasons for its unusual lushness.  

4. Core Questline

    The players become involved in the events unfolding in the Veda Valley, potentially starting in the village of Prithe.   

They encounter the kidnapping of Liasa Neraly Breckenar, which ties into the main quest in an attempt rescue her and thwart Kreel's plans.  

As they investigate, they uncover Kreel's network of allies, his connection to the DarkStone, and the potential involvement of the devil Tawûsê Melek.  

The players must navigate political intrigue, confront Kreel's forces, and ultimately face Kreel himself to prevent his ascension and resolve the threat to the Veda Valley and the Kingdom of Strauthauk.  

This framework provides a solid foundation for the main quest, with opportunities for side quests, exploration, and character development.





	The Search for the "Accounting of Divine Effort":
    	The location of the book is unknown, but it is known to be hidden well.
    	The Supplicants of the Light and Dark, a faction dedicated to preserving ancient knowledge, are also searching for the book, seeking to keep it out of Kreel's hands.
    	A potential quest line involves the players seeking out clues and information from various sources, including ancient libraries, hidden temples, and scholarly NPCs.
	The DarkStone Mines:
    	The primary source of DarkStone is a series of abandoned mines, once used by Memonium's Mind Flayer army.
    	These mines are now dangerous locations, filled with remnants of the Titan's technology, corrupted creatures, and other hazards.
    	A crucial quest involves the players venturing into the mines to secure a large enough quantity of pure DarkStone to prevent Kreel from obtaining it.
	The Ur Priest's Knowledge:
    	Kreel needs an Ur Priest to perform the ascension ritual.
    	These priests are rare, and many have hidden themselves away, fearing the misuse of their power.
    	A quest line involves the players tracking down a knowledgeable Ur Priest, either to gain their aid or to prevent them from falling into Kreel's hands.
	The Devil's Bargain:
    	Tawûsê Melek, while opposing Kreel's goal, may offer the players a temporary alliance, providing them with information or aid in exchange for a future favor.
    	This could lead to a moral dilemma for the players, as they must decide whether to trust a devil and risk unforeseen consequences.
	The Kidnapping of Liasa Neraly Breckenar:
    	Liasa's kidnapping is not just a political move. She is a key component to a ritual Kreel needs, or she has information he needs.
    	This gives the players a time sensitive quest to rescue her.
	The Warlocks and the Cultists:
    	Kreel's followers, the Warlocks, are a growing threat, spreading his influence and gathering resources.
    	The Cultists of Ayam, remnants of the Keepers of the Light, may also be involved, seeking to exploit the chaos for their own ends.
    	This could lead to a series of encounters and investigations, as the players uncover the extent of these factions' involvement.

Adjacent but Integral Side Quests:

	The Lost Forge: The players must find a hidden forge capable of smelting DarkStone, as most have been lost to time.
	The Guardian's Trial: An ancient guardian protects a vital component of the ascension ritual, and the players must prove their worth to obtain it.
	The Seer's Prophecy: A seer, possibly Sira Strauss, provides the players with cryptic prophecies that guide them on their journey.
	The Corrupted Artifact: The players must retrieve or destroy a corrupted artifact that Kreel intends to use in his ritual, an artifact that could have large consequences if left unchecked.




The DarkStone was primarily mined by two races. Dwarves and Gnomes. Additionally, some Mind Flayers who had survived the great war had taken Deurgar and Svirfneblin as slaves to continue mining the ore, so there are some stockpiles in Mind Flayer dens. Primarily, however, the ore has been mined out of the Ferrium Mountain Range and some dense deposits were found deep in Mount Artas. The Kimrl mine has recently struck a new vein of the ore, indicating a place the Pods had crashed deep into the earth and millennia of intermittent volcanic activity has shifted and ground them into the earth. Likewise, many smaller deposits exist within the Ferrium mountains, though these are more rare as much of the DarkStone has been mined out and is now found in hoards.

Okay, let's establish the details of the DarkStone mining operations, keeping in mind the races involved and the key locations:

	Primary Miners:
    	Dwarves: Known for their mining expertise and resilience.
    	Gnomes: Also skilled miners, particularly adept at navigating complex underground environments.
	Forced Labor:
    	Mind Flayers: Surviving Mind Flayers enslaved Duergar (deep dwarves) and Svirfneblin (deep gnomes) to continue mining operations in their dens.
	Major Mining Locations:
    	Ferrium Mountain Range: The primary source of DarkStone. Much of the easily accessible ore has been mined out.
    	Mount Artas: Deep deposits of DarkStone have been discovered within the mountain.
    	Kimrl Mine: A recently discovered vein, indicating a crashed Mind Flayer pod.
	Current State:
    	Most DarkStone is now found in hoards, indicating that large scale mining is not currently happening.
    	The Kimrl mine represents a new source of the ore.




The primary tie-in to the main plot is that Kreel Neraly is going to try to steal some of the DarkStone ore. He can do this through: 1. Diplomatic and trade negotiations for large volumes of ore 2. Banditry and by raiding a trade wagon either himself or using a mercenary. 3. Bribery and spycraft within Kimrl Mine to skim a percentage of the ore and sent it away to Llasak instead in secret.

	Diplomatic and Trade Negotiations:
    	This approach allows for political intrigue and social encounters.
    	Kreel could be using his noble connections and persuasive skills to secure large quantities of ore through legitimate channels.
    	The players could intercept his negotiations, expose his true intentions, or sabotage the trade agreements.
    	This could involve interactions with merchants, dwarven or gnomish representatives, and potentially even King Eirich Strauss's court.
	Banditry and Raids:
    	This creates opportunities for action-packed encounters and heists.
    	Kreel could hire mercenaries or lead raids himself to steal DarkStone shipments.
    	The players could defend trade wagons, track down the raiders, or infiltrate Kreel's hideout to recover the stolen ore.
    	This could involve combat, stealth, and investigation, with the potential for high-stakes chases and confrontations.
	Bribery and Spycraft within Kimrl Mine:
    	This approach focuses on subterfuge and information gathering.
    	Kreel could be using bribes and spies to skim ore from the Kimrl Mine, diverting it to Llasak in secret.
    	The players could uncover his plot, identify his informants, or infiltrate the mine to disrupt his operations.
    	This could involve social interactions, skill checks, and potentially even undercover work within the mine.


Kreel will try these methods in the order we have them here. I think Trade and diplomacy would be the easiest and most fruitful since the Llasak economy is slave-based so they can trade their goods away easily with little repercussions from their people. Mercenary work or banditry would be easy enough as well, but runs the risk of being discovered, identified, and starting a war which could be costly and Llasak might lose. Bribery and spycraft would be the most difficult and still runs the risk of identification and then possibly starting a war, but as most people are somewhat greedy, the method has a high chance of success if Llasak puts up enough gold.


This gives us a clear progression for Kreel's methods of obtaining DarkStone, and it provides a great framework for the players' involvement:

	Diplomatic and Trade Negotiations (Current/Initial Approach):
    	Kreel, leveraging Llasak's slave-based economy, initiates trade negotiations for large volumes of DarkStone ore.
    	This is his preferred method due to its ease and potential yield, minimizing direct conflict and risk.
    	The players could encounter him during these negotiations, perhaps overhearing his true intentions or witnessing suspicious transactions.
    	Possible encounters:
        	Social interactions with merchants and dwarven/gnomish representatives.
        	Investigation of trade documents and ledgers.
        	Political intrigue at King Eirich Strauss's court.
	Banditry and Raids (Secondary Approach):
    	If diplomacy fails or Kreel needs DarkStone quickly, he resorts to hiring mercenaries or leading raids on DarkStone trade wagons.
    	This approach is riskier, potentially leading to identification and war, but offers a faster way to obtain the ore.
    	The players could be tasked with protecting trade wagons, tracking down the raiders, or infiltrating Kreel's hideout.
    	Possible encounters:
        	Action-packed combat encounters with mercenaries or Kreel's forces.
        	Stealth missions to infiltrate Kreel's hideout.
        	Investigation of raid sites and tracking the perpetrators.
	Bribery and Spycraft within Kimrl Mine (Tertiary Approach):
    	As a last resort or a simultaneous, behind the scenes operation, Kreel uses bribery and spies to skim DarkStone ore from the Kimrl Mine.
    	This is the most difficult and risky approach, but its potential for success is high due to the lure of gold.
    	The players could uncover his plot through investigation, identify his informants, or infiltrate the mine to disrupt his operations.
    	Possible encounters:
        	Social interactions with mine workers and officials.
        	Skill checks for gathering information and detecting deception.
        	Undercover work within the mine to expose Kreel's spies.

This progression allows for a dynamic and evolving threat, with Kreel adapting his tactics based on his success and the players' actions. It also allows the players to engage with the main plot in a variety of ways, from political intrigue to action-packed combat and stealth missions.


These three approaches could be a useful progression of the story in a way. We could use the diplomatic approach as an introduction to the problem and have the players convince the court advisor to advise the king against the deal based on the fact that the numbers look suspicious and something about them identifies the economy as slave-labor based which is against the laws of Strauthauk. That could be the characters first major win against Kreel, and it's not even a combat.



Scenario: The Suspicious Trade Agreement

	Setting: King Eirich Strauss's court in Castle Straussen.
	Hook: The players are approached by a concerned court advisor or merchant who has noticed irregularities in a proposed trade agreement between Strauthauk and Llasak.
	Investigation: The players investigate the trade agreement, uncovering discrepancies in the numbers and evidence of Llasak's slave-based economy.
	Evidence Gathering: This could involve:
    	Examining trade documents and ledgers.
    	Interrogating merchants and diplomats.
    	Gathering information about Llasak's economy.
    	Potentially even some social encounters with Kreel himself, as he attempts to smooth over any concerns.
	Presentation to the Court: The players present their findings to the court advisor or directly to King Eirich Strauss, arguing against the trade agreement.
	Outcome: If the players succeed, King Eirich Strauss rejects the trade agreement, dealing Kreel a significant setback.
	Consequences: Kreel is frustrated but not deterred. He begins to consider his secondary approach: banditry and raids.
	Introduction to the larger plot: The players are now aware of Kreel's intentions and the threat he poses, setting the stage for the rest of the campaign.

This scenario offers several advantages:

	Non-Combat Introduction: It allows for a more subtle and nuanced introduction to the main plot, showcasing the players' investigative and social skills.
	Political Intrigue: It introduces the political tensions within Strauthauk and the influence of external forces like Llasak.
	Early Victory: It gives the players an early victory, establishing them as capable and influential figures.
	Foreshadowing: It foreshadows Kreel's resourcefulness and determination, hinting at the escalating conflict to come.



Alright let's discuss how they get to this scene with Kreel to end the Diplomatic/Trade attempt to gain access to DarkStone. I'd like to introduce the characters to the setting in the village of Prithe, because the visual descriptions would be beautiful and vibrant. The King has arrived in Prithe to meet the Llasakian delegation, including Kreel Neraly, the royal ambassador and third Prince of the Llasakian Lords. King Eirich's entourage is great, and can be a starting point for some player characters, as it includes peasants, guards, craftsmen, scholars and the like. This group would even include some court magicians if a player character chose to play a wizard. Additionally the Overlook Tavern is a great starting scene for a gathering of the party. After the King has stayed with his entourage in Prithe for a few days, he will announce his desire to fund the growth and expansion of Prithe, and will leave a small chest of gold to help the citizens begin their improvement. This will be something the players can help with later on, after they return. Players can be introduced as members of the King's entourage, the Llasak delegation, a citizen of Prithe, or just a traveler passing through when the King's party arrived. The King will then travel with his delegation across the trade routes of Strauthauk, through Grothen, and then north through the city of Coschale and then finally on toward the Castle Straussen, where the final encounter of the first arc of the story will take place, in King Eirich's throne room. I think we should have the party get to know Kreel and become tense acquaintances during the journey but without Kreel seeming like a clear evil villain. He may even try to be friendly to the party at first, but something about them rubs him the wrong way.

I. Introduction to Prithe and the King's Arrival:

	Vibrant Setting:
    	Describe Prithe as a picturesque village nestled in the Veda Valley, with lush greenery, a clear river, and quaint cottages.
    	Emphasize the contrast between the beauty of the village and the lingering shadows of the CandleLight Saga, creating a sense of both hope and unease.
	King's Entourage:
    	Introduce the King's entourage as a diverse group of individuals, each with their own stories and motivations.
    	Provide opportunities for the players to interact with these NPCs, establishing relationships and gathering information.
	The Overlook Tavern:
    	Use the tavern as a central hub for the players to meet and interact.
    	Introduce Dannis Kaine, the barkeep, as a source of local gossip and information.
    	Set up a scene where the players can witness the arrival of the Llasakian delegation and Kreel Neraly.

II. The King's Announcement and Departure:

	King's Generosity:
    	King Eirich Strauss announces his desire to support Prithe's growth, leaving a chest of gold as a gesture of goodwill.
    	This act establishes the King as a benevolent ruler and creates a sense of hope for the villagers.
    	It also establishes a potential side quest for the players, as they can help the villagers with their expansion plans.
	The Journey to Castle Straussen:
    	The King's departure sets the stage for the journey across Strauthauk, providing opportunities for exploration and encounters.
    	The journey through Grothen and Coschale allows the players to experience the diverse landscapes and cultures of the kingdom.
    	It also allows for the players to get to know Kreel Neraly.

III. Kreel Neraly's Introduction and Interactions:

	Kreel's Persona:
    	Kreel presents himself as a charming and intelligent diplomat, eager to establish friendly relations with the Strauthauk court.
    	He is careful to conceal his true intentions, but his subtle arrogance and impatience may betray his true nature.
    	He is very interested in the players, and tries to be friendly, but something about them makes him tense.
	Tense Acquaintances:
    	The players have opportunities to interact with Kreel during the journey, engaging in conversations and observing his behavior.
    	Subtle clues and hints can reveal Kreel's hidden agenda, creating a sense of unease and suspicion.
    	These interactions can lead to tense moments and subtle conflicts, as the players and Kreel try to outmaneuver each other.

IV. The Confrontation at Castle Straussen:

	The Trade Agreement:
    	The players have gathered enough evidence to expose the suspicious nature of the trade agreement.
    	They present their findings to the court advisor or directly to King Eirich Strauss.
	The King's Decision:
    	King Eirich Strauss, influenced by the players' evidence, rejects the trade agreement, dealing Kreel a significant setback.
    	This confrontation marks the end of the first act, setting the stage for Kreel's escalation and the players' further involvement.



Derrin Hart who lives nearby Prithe is concerned about the King's idea of expansion. He tells of a curse that exists in the Veda Valley. Prithe is barely outside the edge of the cursed land, but any expansion westward will lead to disaster and ruin, as the fey and other native creatures of the land will rise up and push back any incursions.
