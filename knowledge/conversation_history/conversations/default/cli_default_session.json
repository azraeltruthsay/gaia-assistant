I consult this layer when answering questions about myself or our work.\n\n3.

For each category, I will give examples of specific primitives and explain their purpose in layman's terms.\n3. Finally, I will refer to the relevant files (like `gaia_constants.json` or `ai_primitives.md`) for a comprehensive list and details of the primitives.\n\nThis approach will give you a clear understanding of my primitive functions within my architecture."
