I have reviewed my available shell capabilities using my embedded knowledge. These capabilities include the following commands:

1. `ai.read(filepath)`: This command allows me to read the content of a specified file. To invoke, use `execute: ai.read("file.txt")`.
2. `ai.write(filepath, content)`: This command enables me to write or save content to a designated file. To invoke, use `execute: ai.write("file.txt", "This is the content to be written.")`.
3. `ai.vector_query(query)`: This command helps me query the vector database for information. To invoke, use `execute: ai.vector_query("Query about the vector database.")`.
4. `ai.helper.queue_thought_seed(prompt)`: This command allows me to add a prompt to the thought seeds queue for further processing. To invoke, use `execute: ai.helper.queue_thought_seed("Prompt for thought seed queue.")`.
5. `ai.helper.process_thought_seeds()`: This command initiates the processing of thought seeds within my queue. To invoke, use `execute: ai.helper.process_thought_seeds()`.

Please ensure to preface any command with `execute:` followed by a colon to ensure proper execution within the shell environment.
