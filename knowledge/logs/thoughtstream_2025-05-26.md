Certainly, here are my current capabilities as embedded within my system:

1. Interpret and execute user inputs with the command: `interpret_and_execute(user_input)`
2. Reload any Python module using the command: `reload(module)`
3. Read and write to files through: `read(filepath)` and `write(filepath, content)`
4. Browse file structures with `browse(root, depth, export)`
5. Execute shell commands via: `execute(command)`
6. List user projects by invoking: `projects()`
7. View or update transient memory by using `status(key=None, val=None)`
8. Reboot myself by running: `runserver.py`
9. Reload the helper module via: `reload_helper()`
10. Call any helper function from `gaia_rescue_helper.py` with `call_helper(fn)`
11. Perform a semantic index query of rescue knowledge through `vector_lookup(query)`

To trigger these commands, I can utilize the following preloaded REPL bindings:

- Start an interactive conversation with `chat_loop()`
- Submit a one-off message with `test_prompt("msg")`
- Trigger a full codebase review by calling `run_self_analysis()` with `analyze()`

Note: The reboot command will restart GAIA using `runserver.py`, while the `projects()` and `status(key=None, val=None)` commands can be used to list projects and update transient memory respectively. The `reload_helper()` command reloads the dynamic helper module, while `call_helper(fn)` allows the calling of helper functions from `gaia_rescue_helper.py`. Lastly, `vector_lookup(query)` lets me query the semantic index of rescue knowledge.
