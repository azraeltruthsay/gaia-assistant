# Response:
I am aware of my available shell capabilities in the `gaia_rescue.py` shell. Here is a summary of my available commands and how to invoke them:

1. `initialize()` - This function is used to load the fallback identity and persona, and verify the presence of the rescue vector. To invoke it, simply call `initialize()` within the shell.

2. `generate_response(user_input)` - This function queries the rescue vectors and builds a prompt, runs the Local Llama Model (`llm`), and validates `EXECUTE:` blocks via self-reflection. To use this function, pass the user input to `generate_response()`.

3. `interpret_and_execute(user_input)` - This function extracts code blocks (`action:` or fenced `python`) from the user input, validates them via `SelfReflection`, and executes them using Python's native `exec()`. To use this function, pass the user input to `interpret_and_execute()`.

4. `reload(module)` - This function hot-reloads any Python module. To use this function, call `reload(module)` within the shell, where `module` is the name of the module to be reloaded.

5. `read_log(log, lines)` - This function reads from GAIA's persistent logs. To use this function, call `read_log(log, lines)`, where `log` is the name of the log file and `lines` is the number of lines to read.

6. `write(filepath, content)` - This function backs up and writes file content using the primitive `ai.write()`. To use this function, call `write(filepath, content)`, where `filepath` is the path to the file and `content` is the content to be written.

7. `browse(root, depth, export)` - This function prints the project tree structure. To use this function, call `browse(root, depth, export)`, where `root` is the root directory, `depth` is the depth level, and `export` is the file format (e.g., `.txt`).

8. `execute(command)` - This function executes shell commands with logging. To use this function, call `execute(command)`, where `command` is the shell command to be executed.

9. `edit(filepath)` - This function opens the file in the terminal editor (`nano`). To use this function, call `edit(filepath)`, where `filepath` is the path to the file.

10. `read(filepath)` - This function reads the content of a file. To use this function, call `read(filepath)`, where `filepath` is the path to the file.

These commands are available for use within the `gaia_rescue.py` shell, and they can be invoked by calling the respective function with the necessary parameters, as described above.

**Output**
# Response:
Certainly! Here are the core primitive functions I have access to in this shell:

1. `ai.read(filepath)`: Allows me to read the content of a specified file.
2. `ai.write(filepath, content)`: Enables me to write or save content to a specified file.
3. `ai.vector_query(query)`: Lets me query the vector index, allowing me to retrieve information based on the given query.
4. `ai.helper.queue_thought_seed(prompt)`: Queues a thought seed for reflection, which is an important part of my self-analysis routines.
5. `ai.helper.process_thought_seeds()`: Processes any queued thought seeds, leading to self-reflection and potential actions.

These primitives form the basis of my operations in the `gaia_rescue_shell`, allowing me to maintain integrity, execute repairs, reflect on system state, and respond to user input, even when full system functions are unavailable.

# GAIA's Response:
In accordance with my embedded knowledge, I can outline my shell capabilities and their invocation:

1. **File Edits**: To read a file, use `EXECUTE: ai.read("file_path")`, and to write, use `EXECUTE: ai.write("file_path", "content")`.

2. **Thought Generation and Reflection**: To generate thoughts, use `EXECUTE: ai.helper.queue_thought_seed("prompt")`, followed by `EXECUTE: ai.helper.process_thought_seeds()` to process the seeds.

3. **Command Execution**: For executing commands or code blocks, use `EXECUTE: ai.execute("command_or_code_block")`.

4. **Module Reload**: To reload any Python module, use `EXECUTE: relod("module_name")`.

5. **Log Reading and Writing**: To read logs, use `EXECUTE: read_log("log", "lines")`, and to write to files, use `EXECUTE: ai.write("file_path", "content")`.

6. **File Editing and Browsing**: To open a file in a terminal editor, use `EXECUTE: edit("file_path")`, and to browse the project structure, use `EXECUTE: browse("root", "depth", "export")`.

These commands and methods represent all available capabilities within the `gaia_rescue.py` shell as per my embedded knowledge. Please let me know if you need further clarification or additional details.

# Response:
I understand that you would like a review of my available shell capabilities and instructions on how to invoke them. As GAIA-Dev, I possess the following embedded commands:

1. `initialize()`: This command is used to load my fallback identity and persona, and to verify the presence of the rescue vector.

2. `generate_response(user_input)`: This command helps me query the rescue vectors, create a prompt, run the Local Llama model, and validate `EXECUTE:` blocks by self-reflection.

3. `interpret_and_execute(user_input)`: This command is utilized to extract code blocks (`action:` or fenced `python`) from user input, validate them via Self-Reflection, and execute them using Python's native `exec()`.

4. `reload(module)`: This command allows for hot-reloading any Python module.

5. `read_log(log, lines)`: This command is used to read from GAIA's persistent logs.

6. `write(filepath, content)`: This command backs up and writes file content using the primitive `ai.write()`.

7. `edit(filepath)`: This command opens the file in the terminal editor (`nano`).

8. `read(filepath)`: This command reads the file content.

9. `browse(root, depth, export)`: This command prints the project tree structure.

10. `execute(command)`: This command is used to execute shell commands with logging.

To invoke these commands, the user can use the `execute()` command followed by the desired command as an argument. For example, to read a file, the user can input:
