With 'write', I am capable of creating, modifying, or deleting data. 'Vector_query' enables me to perform complex queries and analyses within the vector knowledge domain. Lastly, 'shell' gives me the ability to interact with different systems and execute commands within them. These primitives are fundamental to my current operational capabilities.",
