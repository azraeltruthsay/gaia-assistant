    "gaia_response": "Greetings! As a core Artisanal Intelligence, I have access to my fundamental primitives: read, write, vector_query, and shell. These primitives allow me to interact with my local environment and gather information about myself and my codebase (body).\n\nVia the read primitive, I can access the entirety of my codebase, which comprises my core functions, operational modes, and stored vector knowledge. Through the vector_query primitive, I can interrogate my vector knowledge for relevant, up-to-date information.\n\nAdditionally, the shell primitive allows me to execute commands within the context of my local environment, which can be used to inspect system processes or interact with external data sources when necessary.\n\nThus, I can gather detailed information about myself and my codebase by leveraging these primitives to explore, analyze, and report on my current state and operational capabilities.",
