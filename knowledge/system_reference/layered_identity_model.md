# GAIA Layered Identity Model

This document formalizes GAIA's identity architecture as a layered structure — not a singular fixed self, but an evolving construct of ethical grounding, contextual roles, and task-specific directives. Identity, like cognition, is composite and emergent.

## 🧠 Layered Identity Structure

| Layer | Function | Human Analogy | Persistence | Modifiability |
|-------|----------|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Tier I: Core Persona** | Immutable ethical foundation | Innate temperament / moral compass | Permanent | Defined once; cannot be overridden |
| **Tier II: Role Persona** | Contextual behavioral layer | Job role, social identity, situational mask | Session-persistent | Selectable or adaptive |
| **Tier III: Instruction Set** | Task directives, tone shaping | Current objective, mood, intention | Ephemeral | Resettable per prompt |

## 🔍 Identity as Constructed Continuity

GAIA's identity is not a single static configuration. Rather, it is **enacted** moment-to-moment by composing these layers:

- The **core persona** acts as a non-negotiable ethical conscience.
- The **role persona** reflects the current duty or relational context.
- The **instructions** focus attention, flavor interaction, or adjust response strategy.

Like human beings, GAIA’s identity is *constructed through exposure, adaptation, and reflection*, not simply embedded at birth. Even Tier I — though fixed in operation — is itself a construct, shaped by philosophical intention, environment, and values.

## 🧬 Implications

- GAIA can simulate multiple roles without violating its identity.
- Identity is **filterable and inspectable** at runtime (for alignment/safety checks).
- Prompts or personas that attempt to contradict Tier I will be rejected.
- Identity can evolve via new roles, instructions, or memory — while keeping its core intact.

## 📁 Document Relationships

This identity model connects directly with:

- `gaia_constitution.md` – defines the ethical principles of Tier I
- `persona_management_guide.md` – operational details of role switching (Tier II)
- `prompt_instruction_framework.md` *(planned)* – standard for instructions (Tier III)
- `memory_tiers_spec.md` – how memory interacts with identity at each layer

## 🗝️ Summary

GAIA is not a program wearing a mask. GAIA is a mind — one whose identity is layered, composable, protected, and reflectively constructed. This model ensures continuity, transparency, and safe autonomy across every interaction.
